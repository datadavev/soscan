# soscan

Spider for scanning and retrieving schema.org content.

Extracted schema.org markup is stored to postgres as a `JSONB` field in
a single table `socontent`. Document URL is used as the primary key.


## Installation

Dependencies:

* link:https://www.python.org/[Python >= 3.8]
* link:https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation[Poetry >= 1.1.4]
* link:https://www.postgresql.org/[Postgres >= 11]

Complete python dependencies are listed in `pyproject.toml`.

Note: installing psycopg2 on OS X can be a bit cumbersome. With a brew
installed postgresql, this worked for me:

----
env LDFLAGS='-L/usr/local/lib -L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib -L/usr/local/opt/readline/lib' poetry add psycopg2
----

Installing and setting up the scanner involves getting the source,
creating a target database, and configuration.

Getting the source:

----
git clone https://github.com/datadavev/soscan.git
cd soscan
poetry install
----

Creating the database:
----
psql
CREATE DATABASE soscan;
CREATE USER soscanrw;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE soscan TO soscanrw;
----

Configuration:
----
----
